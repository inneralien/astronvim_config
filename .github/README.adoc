A user configuration template for https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim[AstroNvim]

* [x] ',' as leader key (see `options.lua`)
* [x] Rust analyzer via rust-tools for inlay hints!
* [x] Solarized colorscheme
* [x] https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/VictorMono[VictorMono Nerd Font]
      (see `options.lua`)
* [x] Disable auto format as it changes some of AstroNvim's lua files when
      editing them. Diffs look ugly.
* [x] CoPilot! (see `plugins/community.lua`)
* [x] Remove indent-blankline because I just really don't like the look of it.
      (see `plugins/disabled.lua`)
* [ ] Add filepath and filename to heirline.lua. Not quite like I want it yet.
* [ ] Add in custom snippets
